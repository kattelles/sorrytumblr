    I'm sorry folks! I originally had my project "Stumblr" at this domain but
  some very nice lawyers at Tumblr&#8482; sent me a cease and desist. I guess imitation is <i>not</i> the sincerest
    form of flattery?
    <br><br>
    Anyway, I'd like to take this opportunity to say that "Stumblr" is a school project I
    completed while at App Academy. It was not created with the intentions
    of fooling anyone into thinking it was the real Tumblr&#8482; or to make money off of the Tumblr&#8482; brand.
    <br><br>
    If you would like to see my <i>school project</i> please continue to
