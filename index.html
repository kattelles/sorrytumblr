    I'm sorry folks! I originally had my project "Stumblr" at this domain but
    Tumblr's very nice lawyers sent me a cease and desist. I guess imitation is <i>not</i> the sincerest
    form of flattery?
    <br><br>
    Anyway, I'd like to take this opportunity to say that "Stumblr" is a school project I
    completed while at App Academy. It was not created with the intentions
    of fooling anyone into thinking it was the real Tumblr or to make money off of the Tumblr brand.

    If you would like to see my <i>school project</i> please continue to
